# Known limitations
{: #known-limitations}

The {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service has the following known limitations.
{: shortdesc}

## Issue: The Ogg audio format is not supported with the Safari browser
{: #limitation-ogg-safari}

**9 September 2022:** By default, the service returns audio in the Ogg audio format with the Opus codec (`audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). However, the Ogg audio format is not supported with the Safari browser. If you are using the the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service with the Safari browser, you must specify a different format in which you want the service to return the audio.

-   For more information about the available formats, see [Supported audio formats](/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-audio-formats#formats-supported).
-   For more information about specifying a format, see [Specifying an audio format](/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-audio-formats#formats-specify).

## Issue: CORS is not supported for neural voices in the Firefox browser
{: #limitation-cors}

**2 December 2020:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support is not available from the Mozilla Firefoxâ„¢ browser for neural voices in the following languages: Arabic, Australian English, Chinese, Dutch (Belgian and Netherlands), Korean, and Swedish.

## Issue: Sampling rate for ogg format with opus codec is always 48 kHz
{: #limitation-opus-rate}

**22 August 2019:** When you specify the `audio/ogg;codecs=opus` audio format, you can optionally specify a sampling rate other than the default 48,000 Hz. However, although the service accepts `48000`, `24000`, `16000`, `12000`, or `8000` as a valid sampling rate, it currently disregards a specified value and always returns the audio with a sampling rate of 48 kHz.
